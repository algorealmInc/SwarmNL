**SwarmNL: A library to build custom networking layers for decentralized applications.**

SwarmNL handles two critical concerns in distributed systems: Scaling and Fault Tolerance. They are considered individually below:

**Fault Tolerance**
Fault tolerance is handled in SwarmNL majorly by redundancy. Redundancy plays an important role in keeping the network telerant of faults by ensuring that other nodes are running and can service the incoming requests. In SwarmNL, redundancy is handled by one techniques:
1. Replication

**Replication**
SwarmNL allows easy replication of data among configured nodes in the network. Here are the following stap
