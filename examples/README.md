## Tutorials

A collection of tutorials with running code examples that showcase the use of SwarmNl in different scenarios.

* [Echo server tutorial](/examples/echo_server/README.md): demonstrates a simple use case of setting up a node and querying the network layer.
* [File sharing application tutorial](/examples/file_sharing_app/README.md): demonstrates the use of storing records in a DHT.
* [Simple game tutorial](/examples/simple_game/README.md): demonstrates the use of gossiping messages over the network.
* [Sharding tutorials](/examples/sharding/README.md): demonstrates splitting a network into shards for scaling and handling communication between various nodes in a shard and across the network, including both hash-based and range-based sharding policies.
* [Replication tutorial](/examples/replication/README.md): demonstrates the replication of data across nodes specially configured to provide redundancy to the network, including peer-cloning, eventual consistency and strong consistency models.
